# Sorting integers with two stacks

The Push_swap project involves sorting an array of integers using two stacks and a set of instructions. The goal is to create a program that sorts the integers received as arguments. This project aims to teach basic algorithms, complexity concepts, and C language programming. The instructions include writing code in C, adhering to coding norms and properly freeing heap-allocated memory space. The stacks 'a' and 'b' contain unique integers, and the task is to sort stack 'a' in ascending order using instructions such as sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rra, and rrb, which swap, push, and rotate elements within the stacks.
